           <p>Automatic Watches</p>
        <p>Automatic or self winding watches use arm motion to wind the watch’s mainspring, making manual winding unnecessary. Watch winders can also wind an automatic watch. Automatic watches are still the most popular watch type among watch enthusiasts. </p>

        <p>Racing watches, not being bound by uniformity, tend to be much flashier. You’ll have far more exotic color and style options when selecting a racing watch than say, a field watch. Just remember that the flashier the watch, the more casual it becomes and dress accordingly. </p>
